## Phase A — Documentation Foundation

**Goal:** A developer with zero prior knowledge can understand, install, and use the package confidently.
**Target audience:** Frontend/backend developers evaluating or integrating the package.

### A1 — Conceptual primer
- [x] Create `docs/guide/what-is-bs.md`
  - What Bikram Sambat is and why it differs from Gregorian
  - Variable month lengths (why Baishakh has 30–32 days)
  - The 57-year offset and why it's not exact
  - BS year range this package supports (2000–2090 / AD 1943–2043)
  - Why Nepal uses two calendars simultaneously

### A2 — Date conversion deep-dive
- [x] Create `docs/guide/date-conversion.md`
  - The epoch: BS 2000-01-01 = AD 1943-04-14 and why this anchor point exists
  - How month lengths are stored (`bs-month-lengths.json` structure)
  - The offset table approach — how cumulative day counts enable O(1) lookup
  - BS→AD algorithm walkthrough (step by step with a real example)
  - AD→BS algorithm walkthrough (binary search on year, linear walk on month)
  - Timezone safety: why everything is UTC internally
  - Edge cases: month boundaries, year boundaries, last day of last month
  - What happens outside the supported range (RangeError)
  - Data sourcing and cross-validation methodology

### A3 — Getting started rewrite
- [x] Rewrite `docs/guide/getting-started.md` (was 32 lines, now full guide)
  - Installation (npm / yarn / pnpm)
  - Step 1: Convert your first date (BS→AD and AD→BS with real output)
  - Step 2: Get today's date in BS
  - Step 3: Render a full month calendar
  - Step 4: Read panchang for a date
  - Step 5: Get events and festivals
  - Step 6: Find auspicious dates
  - TypeScript types reference
  - Common mistakes section (async panchang, month numbering 1-based, timezone)

### A4 — Calendar grid guide
- [x] Create `docs/guide/calendar-grid.md`
  - What `getMonthCalendar` returns (`CalendarMonth` structure)
  - What each `CalendarDay` contains (BS, AD, weekday, panchang, events, isToday)
  - Adjacent/overflow days — what they are and when to show them
  - Enrichment options (`includeAdjacentDays`, `enrichPanchang`, `enrichEvents`)
  - Week alignment: Sunday = 0, how the grid fills to 35–42 cells
  - Navigation: `nextMonth`, `prevMonth`, `monthRange`
  - Performance: async preloading strategy for fast rendering
  - React rendering example

### A5 — Panchang and events rewrite
- [x] Rewrite `docs/guide/panchang-and-events.md` (was 40 lines, now full guide)
  - What panchang is in plain language (not just field names)
  - Tithi explained: what it means, why it drifts from solar days
  - Kshaya (skipped) and Vriddhi (repeated) tithi — what causes them
  - Paksha: Shukla vs Krishna and when each starts
  - Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana: brief plain-language description of each
  - Data coverage: precomputed 2080–2090, fallback for other years
  - Location support: default Kathmandu, custom lat/lon
  - Event resolution: the 4 festival types and how each resolves a date
  - Auspicious classification: what the algorithm checks

### A6 — Update VitePress homepage and sidebar
- [x] Rewrite `docs/index.md` with user-type routing
  - "I want to convert a date" → getting-started
  - "I want to build a Nepali calendar app" → calendar-grid
  - "I want panchang / festival data" → panchang-and-events
  - "I want to understand the math" → date-conversion
  - "I want to see it live" → playground
  - Feature table with BS range, data coverage, bundle size
- [x] Update `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` sidebar with new pages grouped into sections

---

## Phase B — Framework Integration Guides

**Goal:** Developers on specific stacks can copy-paste a working integration.
**Target audience:** Next.js, NestJS, React Native developers.

### B1 — Next.js guide
- [ ] Create `docs/guide/nextjs.md`
  - Server component usage (no `await` needed for conversion, only for calendar)
  - Client component with `useEffect` for calendar grid
  - ISR pattern: generate static calendar pages per BS month
  - App Router vs Pages Router examples
  - Caching `getMonthCalendar` in Route Handlers

### B2 — NestJS guide
- [ ] Create `docs/guide/nestjs.md`
  - Creating a `CalendarService` that wraps the package
  - Calling `preloadAllPanchang()` in `OnModuleInit`
  - Singleton pattern so panchang cache is shared across requests
  - REST endpoint example: GET `/calendar/bs/:year/:month`

### B3 — React Native guide
- [ ] Create `docs/guide/react-native.md`
  - Bundle size note: astronomy-engine fallback is tree-shaken if unused
  - Metro bundler config (ESM support caveat)
  - AsyncStorage caching pattern for offline panchang
  - Example: rendering a month view in a FlatList

---

## Phase C — Reference & Advanced Docs

**Goal:** Power users and contributors have full depth on every feature.

### C1 — Festival system guide
- [ ] Create `docs/guide/festivals.md`
  - The 4 festival resolution methods: `fixed_bs_date`, `tithi_based`, `government_declared`, `fixed_ad_date`
  - How tithi-based festivals find their date each year
  - Kshaya handling: when a festival moves to the preceding day
  - How to add custom festivals with `registerEvents()`
  - Festival provenance: where each event's date came from
  - Current festival coverage list (with gaps noted)

### C2 — Auspicious dates guide
- [ ] Create `docs/guide/auspicious-dates.md`
  - What "auspicious" means algorithmically (tithi + nakshatra + weekday combinations)
  - The category system: `wedding`, `bratabandha`, `grihapravesh`, `religious`, etc.
  - How `isAuspicious()` works
  - How `getAuspiciousDates()` filters a month
  - Known inauspicious periods and how they're encoded

### C3 — Validation and trust guide
- [ ] Review and expand `docs/guide/validation-and-trust.md`
  - How panchang data is generated (astronomy-engine → JSON)
  - Cross-validation against Drik Panchang and Nepal Rashtriya Panchang
  - Data integrity manifest (SHA-256 hashes) and how to verify
  - How to run `pnpm validate:panchang` and `pnpm validate:cross`
  - What to do when a date seems wrong

### C4 — API reference cleanup
- [ ] Review auto-generated `docs/api/reference/` entries
  - Ensure every function has a description (not just type signature)
  - Add example snippets to the 5 most-used functions: `toBS`, `toAD`, `getMonthCalendar`, `getPanchang`, `getEventsForDate`
