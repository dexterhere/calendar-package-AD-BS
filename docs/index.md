# nepali-calendar-engine

A TypeScript package for Bikram Sambat (BS) date conversion, month-calendar generation, panchang lookup, and event resolution. It is designed as a developer-facing engine that other applications can build on top of, not as a full end-user app.

```bash
pnpm add nepali-calendar-engine
```

## What do you want to do?

### "I want to convert dates between BS and AD"

```ts
import { toBS, toAD, today } from 'nepali-calendar-engine'

toBS(new Date(Date.UTC(2025, 3, 14))) // → { year: 2082, month: 1, day: 1 }
toAD({ year: 2082, month: 1, day: 1 }).toISOString().slice(0, 10) // → '2025-04-14'
today() // → { bs, ad, weekday, monthName }
```

### "I want to build a Nepali calendar UI"

```ts
import { getMonthCalendar } from 'nepali-calendar-engine'

const cal = await getMonthCalendar(2082, 1)
// cal.days → 35–42 CalendarDay objects, each with BS date, AD date,
//            panchang, festivals, and auspicious classification
```

---

### "I want panchang, festival, or auspicious-date data"

```ts
import { getPanchang, getEventsForDate, getAuspiciousDates } from 'nepali-calendar-engine'

getPanchang({ year: 2082, month: 1, day: 1 })
// → { tithi: { number: 16, ... }, paksha: 'krishna', nakshatra: {...}, ... }

getEventsForDate({ year: 2082, month: 7, day: 15 })
// → [{ name: 'Vijaya Dashami', isPublicHoliday: true, ... }]

getAuspiciousDates(2082, 2, 'wedding')
// → [{ bs: {...}, classification: 'auspicious', events: [...] }, ...]
```
